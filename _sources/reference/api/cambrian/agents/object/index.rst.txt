.. py:class:: MjCambrianAgentObject(config, name)

   Bases: :py:obj:`cambrian.agents.agent.MjCambrianAgent2D`


   This is a class which defines an object agent. An object agent is
   essentially a non-trainable agent. It's simply an object in the environment which
   has no observations or actions.


   .. py:method:: get_action_privileged(env)

      This is a deviation from the standard gym API. This method is similar to
      step, but it has "privileged" access to information such as the environment.
      This method can be overridden by agents which are not trainable and need to
      implement custom step logic.

      :Parameters: **env** (*MjCambrianEnv*) -- The environment that the agent is in. This can be
                   used to get information about the environment.

      :returns: *List[float]* -- The action to take.
